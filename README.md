A fully responsive and modern developer portfolio built using Flutter Web. This project is a showcase of my skills, projects, and passion for creating smooth, interactive experiences using Flutter.

## 📖 About the Project

This is more than just a portfolio — it’s a real-world Flutter Web app that adapts across devices, uses advanced layouts, and demonstrates clean architecture and performance.

I built this project to not only present myself professionally but also to prove what Flutter can do beyond mobile apps — including responsiveness, animations, routing, and clean code practices.
